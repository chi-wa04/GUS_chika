                        <p>In the lab report #1, I learned important foundational skills. This map answers the question: "Which neighborhoods in Philadelphia contain District schools that both enroll more than 1,200 students and are within 0.1 miles of the bike network?" The dots on the map represent District schools with over 1,200 enrolled students. The five areas highlighted with light blue outlined and shaded in pink show the neighborhoods that meet both criteria and indicate where high-enrollment schools are closely connected to the bike network. I used two skills to create this map: Select by Attributes and Select by Location.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>・Select by Attributes...This skill was used to identify data, for example, I selected the district schools with more than 12,000 students in Lab 1 assignment.<br>・Select by Location...This skill was used to identify locations, for example, I selected the neighborhoods that were placed within 0.1 mile of the bike network.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Complex Assignment: Comparing Homicides and Airbnb Patterns in Chicago</h2>
                        <p>Next one is the most complex assignment for me because we need to take more process and skills to solve questions. The assignment problem is to describe how homicides are distributed by police districts in Chicago and to compare the patterns of homicides, Airbnb listings, and Airbnb prices. The green map shows where homicides happen most often. There are four areas with high homicide density, and the density decreases further away from these areas.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/green.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p> The blue choropleth map shows the distribution of Airbnb review density by police district. Areas with fewer reviews are concentrated in one location, while areas with more reviews are spread out. I used two skills to create this map: Add Join and Calculate Field.</p>
                         <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blue.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>・Add Joins...This skill helps add one layer to another layer. I used this tool to join some tables to the “Police_Districts_Chicago” table.<br>・Calculate Field...It can be used to calculate (e.g. +, -, /, *) some fields. I use it to calculate the density of homicides in Chicago by police district.</br>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Identifying the Best Area for a Healthy Food Store Recommendation</h2>
                        <p>Last map portrays the problem of making a recommendation for the best area. The target location should be: within an area targeted for investment, accessible by public transit, and not nearby current farmers markets or corner stores participating in the Healthy Corner Store Initiative.</p>
                        <p>The following specific spatial criteria are given:<br>1. Within a Philadelphia empowerment zone.<br>2. Within 2000 feet of a subway station or regional rail station.<br>3. NOT within 1200 feet of a farmers’ market or corner store participating in the Healthy Corner Store Initiative.<br>4. A larger contiguous area is preferable to increase the likelihood of securing a potential property.</p>
                        <p>In this map, the dots represent public transit stations (railroads and subways). The areas within the black lines contain farmers' markets and healthy corner stores. The green areas show the recommended locations for a new store selling healthy foods based on the criteria. I learned two skills from this analysis: Buffer and Union.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>・Buffers...This skill can be used to show us the buffer polygon that specific distance from input features. I used it when buffer the regional rail stations and the subway stations, and Buffer the farmers markets and the corner stores.<br>・Union...This tool creates a new data layer that put into buffers together. I unionid the resulting regional rail station buffer and the subways station buffer.</p>
