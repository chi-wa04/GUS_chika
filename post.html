                        <p>In the lab report #1, I learned important foundational skills. This map answers the question: "Which neighborhoods in Philadelphia contain District schools that both enroll more than 1,200 students and are within 0.1 miles of the bike network?" The dots on the map represent District schools with over 1,200 enrolled students. The five areas highlighted with light blue outlined and shaded in pink show the neighborhoods that meet both criteria and indicate where high-enrollment schools are closely connected to the bike network. I used two skills to create this map: Select by Attributes and Select by Location.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>Select by Attributes...This skill was used to identify data, for example, I selected the district schools with more than 12,000 students in Lab 1 assignment.
                            Select by Location...This skill was used to identify locations, for example, I selected the neighborhoods that were placed within 0.1 mile of the bike network.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Complex Assignment: Comparing Homicides and Airbnb Patterns in Chicago</h2>
                        <p>Next one is the most complex assignment for me because we need to take more process and skills to solve questions. The assignment problem is to describe how homicides are distributed by police districts in Chicago and to compare the patterns of homicides, Airbnb listings, and Airbnb prices. The green map shows where homicides happen most often. There are four areas with high homicide density, and the density decreases further away from these areas.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/green.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p> The blue choropleth map shows the distribution of Airbnb review density by police district. Areas with fewer reviews are concentrated in one location, while areas with more reviews are spread out. I used two skills to create this map: Add Join and Calculate Field.</p>
                         <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blue.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>Add Joins: This skill helps add one layer to another layer. I used this tool to join some tables to the “Police_Districts_Chicago” table. 
                           Calculate Field: it can be used to calculate (e.g. +, -, /, *) some fields. I use it to calculate the density of homicides in Chicago by police district.</p>
                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
